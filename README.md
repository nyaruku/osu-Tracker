# Another osu! Tracker
 My own version of an osu! Tracker.

 PROJECT IS WIP (NOT FUNCTIONING RIGHT NOW)
 
# If u want to compile it urself: 
Note: I used VS MSVC
 1. Download the api folder containing the curl and cpr library.

 2. Put the api folder into the '/dep' folder.
 3. Create a Project inside Visual Studio -> Link everything together (also the /dep folder, since there is the json.hpp file)
 4. Compile and Run.
 5. Ask Me if you have any questions or need help.
